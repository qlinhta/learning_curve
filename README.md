#### Project idea:

A centralized personal online learning space (MOOC) for learners

#### Description:

The idea of developing a personal learning space with a focus on features aimed at individual users. Where users can choose the desired courses (a bit similar to today's online learning platforms like Coursera and EDX), but besides that, the breakthrough lies in features such as mapping learning path insights and user learning overview.
Features such as sharing information between users in the community, taking online tests, building a skill development path (such as a skill development route marked by the user's participation in courses) and can also build a dashboard dedicated to the instructor if time permits.

#### Target audience :

Our expected target audience is university students and working people. Those who will spend their free time pursuing a course to supplement their skills, for work or students who want to learn more about their subject of expertise. Courses are geared towards professional skill development.

#### Tech stacks (Estimated):

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Bootstrap

#### Graphic, UX/UI design:

Figma, Adobe PS, Adobe AI

#### First delivery : 29/01/2023
